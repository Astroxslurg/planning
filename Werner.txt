  Professor Stephen Werner joined NTNU recently, having being lecturing in Sweden and Finland before. He teaches signal processing. According to prof. Werner, the major problem he experiences is due to large groups, where students are frequently shy of each other. Students usually hesitate to ask questions and give feedback to the teacher, so it is impossible to know if anyone have problems understanding the material. It is also more difficult to hold attention of all students in a large group during long lectures, hence student's perfomance becomes normally-distributed, with way too great variance. Stephen Werner thinks that it is important for students in the group to be able to rely each other, so a way to know each other is desirable, as well as activities which would motivate students to be engaged actively during the lecture.
  Prof. Werner's opinion is that it is too much subject information is expected to be teached during one long semester, something which requies long-term planning of lectures an therefore makes teaching extremely inflexible. He thinks that a shorter term would facilate flexibility and also make it easer to have overview over the material both for the teacher and for the students.
  Stephen Werner thinks that final exams is a flawed way to evaluate student's perfomance, at least for engineering-related subjects, as it doesn't involve any practice. On the other hand he admits that there is no real alternative for finals as for today. Evaluation based on project work would be perfect, yet in practice it frequently becomes raport-based rather than work-based, which is just as flawed as theoretical exams. Prof. Werner thinks that this is due to lack of a common simple and indicative system of project work evaluation.
